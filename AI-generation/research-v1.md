# Process for AI Music Generation with Audio/MIDI as Input

## 1. Prepare the Audio/MIDI File
- **MIDI Files:**
  - Extract MIDI data from your existing music using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) if it's not already in MIDI format.
  - MIDI files are beneficial as they contain note, velocity, and timing information.
- **Audio Files:**
  - Convert audio files to a format that AI tools can analyze (e.g., MP3, WAV).
  - Optionally, separate stems (melody, harmony, percussion) if needed.

## 2. Choose AI Music Generation Software
Consider using one of the following tools:

- **[Udio](https://www.udio.com/):**
  - Allows users to upload audio files, which the AI analyzes to guide the tempo and mood of the generated music.
  - Supports song lengths up to 15 minutes, providing greater control over the output.
  - Offers features such as remixing and extending existing tracks, creating custom variations, and enhancing the overall composition.
  - Learn more about Udio's capabilities at [Udio AI Music Generator](https://www.udio.com/).

- **[Google Magenta Studio](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio):**
  - Works with MIDI files and provides plugins like "Continue" to extend music.

- **[AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai):**
  - Allows MIDI uploads to generate variations or entirely new compositions.

- **[Suno AI](https://suno.ai):**
  - Features advanced music generation with remastering capabilities for uploaded audio tracks.

- **[Amper Music](https://www.ampermusic.com):**
  - Ideal for complementing melodies with AI-driven instrumentation.

- **[Harmonia](https://harmonia.app)** or **[Boomy](https://boomy.com):**
  - Suitable for casual, generative music outputs.

- **[Soundraw](https://soundraw.io):**
  - Enables fine-tuning of compositions for specific use cases.

## 3. Input the File into the AI Tool
- Upload your **MIDI** or **audio file** into the selected platform.
- For tools that don’t directly support audio, transcribe the audio into MIDI using software like:
  - **[AnthemScore](https://www.anthemscore.com)**
  - **[Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne)**
  - **[Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius)**

---

## 4. Define Your Prompt
- Create a textual or parameterized prompt to guide the AI. Include:
  - **Style or Genre:** e.g., "Transform this into a string quartet arrangement."
  - **Instrumentation:** e.g., "Add a piano and strings."
  - **Length or Complexity:** Specify the desired length or complexity of the output.
  - **Emotional Tone or Mood:** e.g., "Make this melody uplifting."

---

## 5. Generate Variations or Extensions
- Use the AI tool’s generation feature to create new music based on your prompt and file.
- Adjust sliders, parameters, or settings to refine the output.

---

## 6. Refine and Post-Process
- Export the generated music for further editing in a DAW, such as:
  - **Ableton Live**
  - **FL Studio**
  - **Logic Pro**
- Enhance the track by layering additional elements like percussion or sound design, and correct any discrepancies in the AI-generated output.

---

## 7. Iterate with Feedback
- If supported, provide feedback to the AI to refine the result.
- Regenerate sections or adjust dynamics to align with your creative vision.

---

## 8. Combine Outputs
- Blend the original music with the AI-generated segments to create a cohesive piece.
- Use overlapping, layering, or sequencing in your DAW for seamless integration.

---

## Example Workflow Using MIDI in Magenta Studio
1. Load the MIDI file into **Magenta Studio**’s "Continue" plugin.
2. Define generation parameters, such as target genre or length of the continuation.
3. Allow the AI to process and extend the MIDI.
4. Export the result for fine-tuning in your DAW.
